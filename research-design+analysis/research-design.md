# Research Design, Analysis and Visualizations

Goodreads users are treated as a specific community of users (what is popular amongst the online Goodreads community may not be popular amongst patrons at a community library), thus the goal of the project is not to generate universal or generizable insights about the popularity of specific types of literature in society at large.

While Goodreads collects user feedback about books in the form of written reviews, the project sought to rely on book metadata, rather than Goodreads user data, to mirror an environment which preserves patron privacy and trust by not including individual borrower information in analysis. In a public library setting, circulation counts for books could be used to proxy book popularity, which in this project is tracked by the books' nominations for the Goodreads Readers' Choice awards.

## Research Questions
What trends in subject matter existed in the books that won the readersâ€™ favorite awards across the studied years?
To what degree are the trends in popular topics persistent? (And what does that imply about the use of metadata analysis in library collection development practices)
