# Phase 4- Visualizing Your Data

In order to effectively analyze the data collected for this project, I used tableau to create a series of visualizations identifying a variety of trends in the dataset, which are described in the [project write up](https://mc2398.github.io/graduate_portfolio/goodreads_article.html) on my portfolio.  Interactive visualizations are available to explore in that write up.  Static versions of the visualizations are also available in [final-vis](visualization-process/final-vis).

Initial drafts of the visualizations are available in [exploratory-vis](/exploratory-vis)
