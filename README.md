# Final Project Title TBD

This project was completed as part of a capstone-level graduate data visualization course, as part of course work towards a Masters of Science in Library and Information Science. 

The repository includes walkthroughs and code, which are designed to allow code-savvy librarians or digital humanists to conduct similar metadata analysis of a cultural heritage institution's collection.  
The stages of the project can be explored chronologically (the order in which I approached the project) or as needed.  Depending on the availability of data and goals of your project, some stages may not be necessary.  

1. [Web Scraping](/web-scraper/web-scraper.md)
2. [Data Transformation](/data-transforming/data-transforming.md)
3. [Topic Modeling](/topic-modeling/topic-modeling.md)
4. [Visualizing the Data](/visualization-process/vis-process.md)

## Notes about this Project
As part of this project, I conducted analysis on a subset of metadata from Goodreads, both to develop insights about a subset of popular books amongst the Goodreads user community, and to develop a data pipeline for metadata analysis which could be applied to future projects in a library setting.  
For information about the specific analysis, findings, and guiding research questions which informed my approach to the project, explore [research-design.md](/research-design+analysis/research-design.md)  

## Basic Requirements to Replicate the Project
Software: Google CoLab or an IDE for running Python, Open Refine (helpful but not required for transforming data), Sheets or Excel, Data Visualization Tool of Choice (I used Tableau Public)  
Technical Skill: Introductory Python, knowledge of RegEx, data literacy  
Data: See [data-transforming.md](/data-transforming/data-transforming.md)  
Time: (To be updated to reflect total project time)
