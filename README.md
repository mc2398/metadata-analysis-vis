# Final Project Title TBD

This project was completed as part of a capstone-level graduate data visualization course.  

The repository includes a tutorials and code, which are designed to allow code-savvy librarians or digital humanists to conduct similar metadata analysis of a collection.  
The stages of the project can be explored chronologically (the order in which I approached the project) or as needed.  Depending on the availability of data and goals of your project, some stages may not be necessary.

1. Web Scraping
2. Data Transformation
3. Topic Modeling
4. Visualizing the Data
