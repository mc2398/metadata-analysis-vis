# Final Project Title TBD

This project was completed as part of a capstone-level graduate data visualization course, as part of course work towards a Masters of Science in Library and Information Science. 

The repository includes a tutorials and code, which are designed to allow code-savvy librarians or digital humanists to conduct similar metadata analysis of a collection.  
The stages of the project can be explored chronologically (the order in which I approached the project) or as needed.  Depending on the availability of data and goals of your project, some stages may not be necessary.

2. [Data Transformation](/data-transforming/)
3. [Topic Modeling](/topic-modeling/)
4. [Visualizing the Data](/visualization-process)

## Notes about this Project
As part of this project, I conducted analysis on a subset of metadata from Goodreads, both to develop insights about a subset of popular books amongst the Goodreads user community, and to develop a data pipeline for metadata analysis which could be applied in a library setting.  
For information about the specific analysis, findings, and guiding research questions which informed my approach to the project, explore [research-design.md](/research-design+analysis/research-design.md)
