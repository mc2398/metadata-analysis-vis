# Transforming your Data

## Tools
For my project, I used a combination of Google Sheets and [OpenRefine]() 
As of spring 2025, Google Sheets has a file size limit of 100MB and a maximum number of cells (across all sheets in a project) of 10 million cells. OpenRefine can similarly work with a large amount of data, however, with very large collections, it may be helpful to work with subsets of the collection, or to use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) to conduct initial analysis.
